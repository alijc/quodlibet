# quodlibet
Scripts for creating quodlibets

A quodlibet is a piece of music combining several different melodies, usually popular tunes, in counterpoint and often a light-hearted, humorous manner. The term is Latin, meaning "whatever" or literally, "what pleases."  (shamelessly ripped out of Wikipedia)

These scripts will attempt to find possible quodlibets from a collection of songs in abc music notation.
